# simple E-commerce_Database-design(like ebay)
Designed a data model, created tables and inserted data into the tables
Run the Table_creating_queries for creating the tables
Then run the constraints_queries to add constraints to the tables created
Then run bulk insert for supported queries to insert data into some of tables
Rest of tables are not supported by bulk insert hence we got to manually insert the data insert_query_auction,insert_query_item,insert_insert_query_member_accounts
Have fun learning
